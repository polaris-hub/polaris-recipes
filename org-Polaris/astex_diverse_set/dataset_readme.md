## Background

The Astex Diverse set is a well-established and commonly-used benchmark for evaluating docking methods. It was published in 2007 is a set of hand-picked, relevant, diverse, and high-quality proteinâ€“ligand complexes from the PDB. The complexes were downloaded from the PDB as MMTF files and PyMOL was used to remove solvents and all occurrences of the ligand of interest from the complexes before saving the proteins with the cofactors in PDB files and the ligands in SDF files.
