## Background

### Target details
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is frequently overexpressed or mutated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer. This makes EGFR a crucial target for cancer therapies such as Cetuximab, an antibody with more than 1B USD in annual revenue.

### Binding protein designs
This dataset contains 202 designed EGFR-binding protein sequences, along with experimental binding affinity results tested by the AdaptyvBio team, plus 11 additional sequences ordered by Anthony Gitter and tested by the AdaptyvBio team.

### Updates
Compared to version v0, the two weak binders which were classified as binders are now classified as non-binders in v1 due to their relatively weak interactions, which may not be stable or effective in inhibiting EGFR.
The names of weak binders are "alecl-Sequence1" and "alan.blakely-design:5 n:6|mpnn:1.247|plddt:0.825|ptm:0.709|pae:10.151|rmsd:3.535".
