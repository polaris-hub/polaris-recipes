## Background

### Target details
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is frequently overexpressed or mutated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer. This makes EGFR a crucial target for cancer therapies such as Cetuximab, an antibody with more than 1B USD in annual revenue.

### Binding protein designs
This dataset contains 202 designed EGFR-binding protein sequences, along with experimental binding affinity results tested by the AdaptyvBio team. 

The affinity constants (KD) in this dataset were calculated as the average of the experimental replicates. The KD values were then converted into binary labels `binding_class`.

An additional data package containing raw lab data and kinetic curves can be downloaded [here](https://api.adaptyvbio.com/storage/v1/object/public/egfr_design_competition/package.zip).
